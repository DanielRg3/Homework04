# HomeWork#4: Quiz with TImer

## Project Description:
In this project, a quiz is generated with the following criteria:
1. The user has 60 seconds to answer 4 questions
1. Each correct answer sums 25pts
1. If the answer is wrong 5 seconds will be removed from the total timer
1. If the timer goes off, the remaining unanswered questions will be incorrect.

At the end a message showing the amount of points the user made is displayed.

## What I Learned:
In this project I learned how to create a start button.
Also, how to set up a timer that will decrement each second (1,000ms).

HTML and CSS styling was also reviewed in this project.

And most inportantly, the use of if statements.
This project used a lot of ifs for each desision that was left open for the user to decide.
